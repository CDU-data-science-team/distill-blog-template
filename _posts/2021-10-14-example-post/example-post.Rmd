# Create a post

Type `distill::create_post("Example post")` and the folder is set up with the date run in the name in the folder `_posts` ![Snapshot of the folder as it appears in the Files section of RStudio](img/post-folder.PNG)

There are further details on posts on the [RStudio {distill} site](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/blog.html#creating-a-post).


# Knit the post

Once the post has been created, knit this to create an html page by either using the Knit button in RStudio (a ball of wool with needles icon) or typing the shortcut keys <kbd> Ctrl + Shift + K </kbd>. 

#### GitHub Actions

Although the GitHub Actions build the site automatically, it does not extend to creating the `html` from the `Rmd` files as an action would have to refer to a particular file name which changes for each post. See the [About page](https://cdu-data-science-team.github.io/distill-blog-template/about.html) for more information on the building of the site.

# Preview picture

The picture listed in the `yaml` called `img/Lincoln's-Inn-Fields-and-the-localities-adjacent-p264.jpg` shows up in the main page. This particular picture is from the [British Library](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11142658024/in/album-72157715098178598/) and has no copyright restrictions. Other commons copyright pictures can be found through Jenny Bryan's GitHub repository [free-photos](https://github.com/jennybc/free-photos).

# Colour and font

[NHS branding](https://www.england.nhs.uk/nhsidentity/identity-guidelines/fonts/) recommends using Arial as the secondary font. The primary, Frutiger, is paid for so is not used in this site.

The colour of the band is from the [NHS colour branding](https://www.england.nhs.uk/nhsidentity/identity-guidelines/colours/) from Level 3: NHS support greens.

Both settings can be found (and changed) in the `styles.css` file.
