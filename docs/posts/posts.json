See the About page for more information on the building of the site.\r\nPreview picture\r\nThe picture listed in the yaml called img/Lincoln's-Inn-Fields-and-the-localities-adjacent-p264.jpg shows up in the main page. This particular picture is from the British Library and has no copyright restrictions. Other commons copyright pictures can be found through Jenny Bryan’s GitHub repository free-photos.\r\nColour and font\r\nNHS branding recommends using Arial as the secondary font. The primary, Frutiger, is paid for so is not used in this site.\r\nThe colour of the band is from the NHS colour branding from Level 3: NHS support greens.\r\nBoth settings can be found (and changed) in the styles.css file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
